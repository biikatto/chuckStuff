------\ SndBufPlus /------

Chubgraph that gives an interface for basic
sample manipulation, with comprehensive control
over sample start and end points.

All methods from SndBuf have been exposed.

trigger()- triggers the sample to play
	back from the start point until end
	point

stop()-	stops the sample

reverse()- reverses playback direction

normalize()- adjusts gain so that highest value
	sample = 1.0


startPhase(float, read/write)-
	sets the start position as phase position

endPhase(float,read/write)-
	sets the end position as phase position

lengthPhase(float, read/write)- 
	sets the playback length as phase amount

startPosition(int, read/write)-
	sets the start position as sample index

endPosition(int, read/write)-
	sets the end position as sample index

lengthSamples(int read/write)-
	sets the playback length as number of
	samples

startDuration(dur, read/write)-
	sets the start position as duration
	into the sample

endDuration(dur, read/write)-
	sets the end posistion as duration
	into the sample

lengthDuration(dur, read/write)-
	sets the playback duration
